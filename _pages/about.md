Hi there, thanks for visiting my space, this is xueyang! I'm a fourth-year CS PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, exploring the intersection of design, wellbeing, social equity/justice, and what it means to be human through digital systems. I'm a member of tandem lab and advised by Dr. [Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org). 

I'm currently located in Kyoto, Japan for a summer internship with Dr. [Naomi Yamashita](http://naomi-yamashita.net) to study how international residents in Japan use AI chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT) to navigate cultural adaptation, language barriers, and help-seeking in everyday life. [Jun 2025]

Before starting my PhD, I worked at SambaNova Systems as a hardware engineer (2020 - 2021). I received Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020.

哈喽，可以叫我雪杨！我本科毕业于上海交通大学密歇根学院，目前在美国佐治亚理工学院攻读计算机科学博士，主要关心如何将计算机技术应用于社会公平问题，以及利用科技改善个人的身心健康（well-being）。

[2025年6月]目前我居住在日本京都，师从[山下直美](http://naomi-yamashita.net)和[Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org)老师，正在开展有关在日外国人如何使用AI适应日本生活的研究。

Research 📚
======
My research draws on interdisciplinary insights from philosophy, anthropology, sociology, psychology, and critical theory — particularly feminist and queer theory — to investigate how technology shapes everyday human experience.

Previously, I worked as a computer architect with a focus on GPU and high-performance systems, which grounds my current work in a deep technical understanding of computing infrastructure. This technical background enables me to approach HCI challenges with both systems-level thinking and human-centered inquiry.

My broader interests include spirituality, the arts, and languages, all of which shape my perspective as I envision more meaningful and equitable technological futures. Woven through these influences, gender and sexuality form the underpinning framework through which I engage questions of embodiment, identity, and power.
