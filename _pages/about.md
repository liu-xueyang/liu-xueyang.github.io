Hi there, thanks for visiting my space, this is xueyang! I'm a fourth-year CS PhD student at *Georgia Institute of Technology*, exploring the intersection of *design*, *wellbeing*, *social equity/justice*, and what it means to be human through digital systems. I also work on an AI-centered startup called **Paradisia**.

Before starting my PhD, I worked at *SambaNova Systems* as a hardware engineer (2020 - 2021). I received Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from *University of Michigan* and *Shanghai Jiao Tong University* in 2020.

👩🏻‍💻 你好，可以叫我雪杨！我是佐治亚理工学院计算机科学博士生，研究人机交互（HCI）。我的研究融合批判理论（如女性主义、酷儿理论）、人类学、社会学以及心理学，用跨学科的视角探索科技如何促进社会公平，以及改善人们的心理健康与日常生活体验。我同时在主导一个AI驱动的创业项目，命名为**天堂列车/Paradisia**。

我本科毕业于上海交大，曾是一名硬件工程师，现在更爱从人本视角思考技术。私下热衷灵性话题、艺术和做菜，相信科技与人文的碰撞能创造更好的未来✨

Research 📚
======
My research draws on interdisciplinary insights from *philosophy*, *athropology*, *sociology*, *psychology*, and *critical theory* — particularly *feminist* and *queer theory* — to investigate how technology shapes everyday human experience.

Previously, I worked as a computer architect with a focus on GPU and high-performance systems, which grounds my current work in a deep technical understanding of computing infrastructure, enabling me to approach HCI challenges with both systems-level thinking and human-centered inquiry.

My broader interests include spirituality, the arts, and languages, all of which shape my perspective as I envision more meaningful and equitable technological futures. Woven through these influences, gender and sexuality form the underpinning framework through which I engage questions of embodiment, identity, and power.
