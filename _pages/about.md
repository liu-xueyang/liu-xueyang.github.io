Hey! Thanks for visiting! I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology, focusing on Computer Architecture. I'm a member of [the HPArch lab](http://hparch.gatech.edu/index.html) and advised by Prof. [Hyesoon Kim](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hyesoon/). 

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked at SambaNova Systems as a hardware engineer (2020 - 2021). I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2020.

You can find my CV [here](http://liu-xueyang.github.io/files/Xueyang-Liu-CV.pdf).

Research Interest
======
Within the scope of computer architecture, I'm specifically interested in memory architectures that support emerging compute requirements, such as improving performance for emerging data-heavy workloads and building secure memory architecture. I believe memory is and will continue be a significant bottleneck as we head toward faster and better compute, and I'm passionate to contribute to smarter memory for the future! 

My vision as a computer architect is that we always want to develop more efficient interaction between software and hardware. For example, we create specialized hardware if we know the targeted software application to achieve higher performance and energy efficiency. Through my research, I also hope to push the boundaries in finding a balance between general purpose and specialized hardware.
