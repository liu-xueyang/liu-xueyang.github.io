Hey! Thanks for visiting! I'm currently a second-year Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology, focusing on Computer Architecture. I'm a member of [HPArch](https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/) and advised by Prof. [Hyesoon Kim](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hyesoon/). 

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked at SambaNova Systems as a hardware engineer (2020 - 2021). I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2020.

Research Interest
======
Within the scope of computer architecture, I'm specifically interested in memory architectures that support emerging compute requirements, such as improving performance for data-heavy workloads using Process-In-Memory(PIM) technology. I believe memory will continue be a significant bottleneck as we head toward faster and better compute, and I'm passionate to contribute to smarter memory for the future! 

My vision as a computer architect is to focus on more efficient interaction between software and hardware. For example, we create specialized hardware if we know the targeted software application to achieve higher performance and energy efficiency. On the other hand, building hardware-aware software stack can maximize the hardware utilization. Through my research, I hope to push the boundaries in finding a balance between general purpose and specialized architecture.
