Hey! Thanks for visiting! I'm currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology, focusing on Computer Architecture. I'm a member of [HPArch](https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/) and advised by Prof. [Hyesoon Kim](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hyesoon/). 

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked at SambaNova Systems as a hardware engineer (2020 - 2021). I received Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2020.

Research Interest
======
Within the scope of computer architecture, I'm specifically interested in memory/storage architectures that support emerging compute requirements, such as architecting In-Storage Processors to improve data-heavy workloads. I'm also interested in heterogeneous system design, especially those associated with data bottlenecks.

My vision as a computer architect is to focus on more efficient interaction between software and hardware. It's been popular to create specialized hardware for targeted application to achieve higher performance and energy efficiency. However, it's not trivial how to build hardware-aware and hardware-compatible software stack to maximize the utilization. Through my research, I hope to fit in this gap and push the boundaries in balancing general purpose and specialized architecture.
