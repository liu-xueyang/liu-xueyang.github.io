Hi there, thanks for visiting my space, this is xueyang! I'm a fifth-year CS PhD student at *Georgia Institute of Technology*, exploring the intersection of *design*, *wellbeing*, *social equity/justice*, and what it means to be human through digital systems.

Before starting my PhD, I worked at *SambaNova Systems* as a hardware engineer. I received Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from *University of Michigan* and *Shanghai Jiao Tong University*.

👩🏻‍💻 你好，可以叫我雪杨！我是一名佐治亚理工学院计算机科学系，研究人机交互（HCI）方向的博士生。我的研究融合批判理论（如女性主义、酷儿理论）、人类学、社会学以及心理学，用跨学科的视角探索如何利用科技促进社会公平，以改善大众的的身心健康与日常生活。

我本科毕业于上海交大密西根学院双学位项目，曾是一名硬件工程师，现在更爱从人本视角思考技术。私下里，我热衷灵性探索、艺术与生活美学，相信科技与人文的碰撞会带领我们创造更好的未来✨

Research 📚
======
My research draws on interdisciplinary insights from *philosophy*, *athropology*, *sociology*, *psychology*, and *critical theory* — particularly *feminist* and *queer theory* — to investigate how technology shapes everyday human experience.

Previously, I worked as a computer architect with a focus on GPU and high-performance systems, which grounds my current work in a deep technical understanding of computing infrastructure, enabling me to approach HCI challenges with both systems-level thinking and human-centered inquiry.

My broader interests include spirituality, the arts, and languages, all of which shape my perspective as I envision more meaningful and equitable technological futures. Woven through these influences, gender and sexuality form the underpinning framework through which I engage questions of embodiment, identity, and power.
