Hi there, thanks for visiting my space, this is xueyang! I'm a fourth-year CS PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, exploring the intersection of design, wellbeing, social equity/justice, and what it means to be human through digital systems. I'm a member of tandem lab and advised by Dr. [Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org). 

I'm currently located in Kyoto, Japan for a summer internship with Dr. [Naomi Yamashita](http://naomi-yamashita.net) to study how international residents in Japan use AI chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT) to navigate cultural adaptation, language barriers, and help-seeking in everyday life. [Jun 2025]

Before starting my PhD, I worked at SambaNova Systems as a hardware engineer (2020 - 2021). I received Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020.

👩🏻‍💻 你好，可以叫我雪杨！我是佐治亚理工学院计算机科学博士生，研究人机交互（HCI）。我的研究融合批判理论（如女性主义、酷儿理论）、人类学与社会心理学，用跨学科的视角探索科技如何促进社会公平，以及改善人们的心理健康与日常生活体验。

[2025年6月] 目前我在日本京都进行田野调查，研究隶属于[山下直美](http://naomi-yamashita.net)实验室和[Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org)老师的合作项目，正在开展有关在日外国人如何使用AI适应日本生活的研究。

我本科毕业于上海交大，曾是一名硬件工程师，现在更爱从人本视角思考技术。私下热衷灵性话题、艺术和做菜，相信科技与人文的碰撞能创造更好的未来✨

Research 📚
======
My research draws on interdisciplinary insights from philosophy, anthropology, sociology, psychology, and critical theory — particularly feminist and queer theory — to investigate how technology shapes everyday human experience.

Previously, I worked as a computer architect with a focus on GPU and high-performance systems, which grounds my current work in a deep technical understanding of computing infrastructure. This technical background enables me to approach HCI challenges with both systems-level thinking and human-centered inquiry.

My broader interests include spirituality, the arts, and languages, all of which shape my perspective as I envision more meaningful and equitable technological futures. Woven through these influences, gender and sexuality form the underpinning framework through which I engage questions of embodiment, identity, and power.
