Hi there, thanks for visiting my space, this is Xueyang! I'm a fourth-year CS PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, exploring the intersection of design, wellbeing, and social justice in digital systems. I'm a member of tandem lab and advised by Dr. [Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org). 

Before starting my PhD, I worked at SambaNova Systems as a hardware engineer (2020 - 2021). I received Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2020.

Research ðŸ“š
======
My research draws on interdisciplinary insights from philosophy, anthropology, sociology, psychology, and critical theory to investigate how technology shapes everyday human experience.

Previously, I worked as a computer architect with a focus on GPU and high-performance systems, which grounds my current work in a deep technical understanding of computing infrastructure. This technical background enables me to approach HCI challenges with both systems-level thinking and human-centered inquiry.

My broader interests include spirituality, arts, languages, and inquiries into gender and sexuality, all of which continue to inform my perspective as I seek to design more meaningful and equitable technological futures.
